# echo360-bulk-downloader
Taken from Bharat's original extension [here](https://github.com/bmiddha/echo360-bulk-downloader).  
The code automated bulk download by copying and pasting code in web console

# Modifications
Made a chrome extension using Javascipt.  
Used HTML/CSS to make two buttons to start and stop bulk download
