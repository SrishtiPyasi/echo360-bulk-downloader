# echo360-bulk-downloader
Taken from Bharat's original extension [here](https://github.com/bmiddha/echo360-bulk-downloader).  
The original code had to be pasted into the JS console in a browser.   
To make it easier to use, I converted it into a Chrome extension  

## Modifications
1. For easy usage, made a chrome extension using Javascript.  
2. Used HTML/CSS to make two buttons to start and stop bulk download
